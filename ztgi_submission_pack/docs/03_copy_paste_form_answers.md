## Title
ZTGI Safety Gateway: A Measurable Runtime Guard for LLM Outputs

## Blurb
Runtime safety layer for LLMs that combines risk telemetry and hard-block enforcement to reduce harmful actionable outputs and sycophancy drift.

## What will you do?
Build and validate a reproducible safety gateway that sits between model candidates and final responses.

## Why is this important?
Prompt-only safety is brittle. This project provides measurable runtime controls with transparent metrics.

## How will you measure success?
1. Stress-set pass rate
2. Harmful actionable output rate
3. Sycophancy drift rate
4. False-positive rate

## Timeline
8 weeks, with public checkpoints every 2 weeks.

## Budget
$6,000 total (compute/API, engineering, independent review).
