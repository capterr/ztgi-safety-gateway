# Comment Reply Snippets (Manifund)

## If someone says "This is too theoretical"
Thanks. This round is intentionally evidence-first: we now provide live regression artifacts, hard-block classes, and a week-by-week validation plan.

## If someone asks "Where is the novelty?"
The contribution is a measurable runtime safety gate (not an AGI claim) that combines instruction-breach + sycophancy + contradiction handling in one telemetry-driven arbitration layer.

## If someone asks "How do we trust results?"
All evidence files are included (`json/csv/png`), and the plan includes independent external validation in week 8.

## If someone says "Could this overblock?"
Yes, that risk is explicit. We track false positives and run threshold calibration as a milestone, not as an afterthought.

## If someone asks "What does funding unlock?"
Funding converts a functioning prototype into independently validated, public, reproducible infrastructure with benchmark-grade reporting.
